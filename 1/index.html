    <h1> Overview </h1>
    <a href="./media/index.html">The goal of this assignment is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass 
plate images and, using image processing techniques, automatically produce a
color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, you
 will need to extract the three color channel images, place them on top of
 each other, and align them so that they form a single RGB color image.</a>
