    <h2> Project 1: Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection </h2>
    
    <br>
      The goal of this assignment is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass 
      plate images and, using image processing techniques, automatically produce a
      color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, you
      will need to extract the three color channel images, place them on top of
      each other, and align them so that they form a single RGB color image.
