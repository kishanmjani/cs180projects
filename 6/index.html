                    Image quilting is a relatively straightforward algorithm for texture synthesis 
                    and texture transfer, originally introduced by Efros and Freeman in their
                     SIGGRAPH 2001 paper. 

                    Texture synthesis involves generating a larger texture image from a small 
                    sample by intelligently combining overlapping patches to ensure seamless 
                    transitions. 

                    Texture transfer extends this idea by giving an object the appearance of a 
                    texture sample while preserving its underlying shape, such as overlaying a 
                    texture onto a face while maintaining facial features. 

                    The Efros-Freeman algorithm works by sampling patches from the texture and 
                    arranging them in overlapping patterns, minimizing visual discrepancies in the 
                    overlapping regions. This is achieved by computing optimal seams, where pixels 
                    with similar intensities are selected for smooth blending. Here optimal is in 
                    the sense of SSD between two overlapping images and the seam is found using 
                    min-cut.

                    In this project, we automate the detection of facial keypoints using 
                    convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch, building on previous work 
                    from Project 3 that involved manual keypoint selection. Facial keypoints, 
                    such as those around the eyes, nose, and mouth, are identified on faces in 
                    images to enable advanced analysis. In the case of Project 3, we used keypoints
                    for morphing. We use the IMM Face Database and the 
                    IBUG face in the wild dataset. This project progressively develops a 
                    robust neural net-based system capable of detecting faces and predicting the 
                    precise locations of facial keypoints.
