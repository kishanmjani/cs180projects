                <h2>Part 1: Nose Tip Detection</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, we use the IMM Face Database for training an initial toy model for nose tip detection. 
                    The dataset contains 240 facial images of 40 individuals, with each person having 6 images taken from 
                    various viewpoints. Each image is annotated with 58 facial keypoints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For training, we use all 6 images of the first 32 individuals (indexes 1-32), resulting in a total 
                    of 192 training images. The remaining 8 individuals (indexes 33-40) provide 48 images for validation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nose detection task is cast as a pixel coordinate regression problem. Each input is a grayscale 
                    image, and the output is the nose tip position represented as normalized coordinates <code>(x, y)</code>, 
                    ranging from 0 to 1.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
                <p>
                    To load and preprocess the images, we use the <code>torch.utils.data.DataLoader</code>. Each image is 
                    converted to grayscale, normalized to the range -0.5 to 0.5 using the formula 
                    <code>image.astype(np.float32) / 255 - 0.5</code>, and resized to 80x60 pixels.

                <h3>Model Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using <code>torch.nn.Module</code>. The architecture 
                    consists of convolutional layers (<code>torch.nn.Conv2d</code>) followed by ReLU activations and max-pooling 
                    layers (<code>torch.nn.MaxPool2d</code>). After the convolutional layers, the network includes two fully 
                    connected layers, with a ReLU activation after the first but not the last. Below is an image describing the precise 
                    architecture. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The loss function is <code>torch.nn.MSELoss</code>, and the optimizer is Adam 
                    (<code>torch.optim.Adam</code>) with a learning rate of <code>1e-3</code>. The network is trained for 10 to 25 epochs.

                <h3>Training/Validation Loss Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is an example of the training and validation loss plot over several epochs. Loss stabilizes, indicating 
                    the need for significantly many more epochs for further improvement.

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    The model performs well for faces with straightforward orientation and neutral expressions. However, it struggles 
                    with images containing strong lighting contrasts, unusual facial expressions, or tilted faces. In some cases, 
                    other parts of the face (e.g., the cheekbone) are incorrectly identified as the nose tip.
