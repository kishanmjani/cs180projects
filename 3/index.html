                <h2>Part 3.1: Defining Correspondences</h2>
                <p>
                    In this part, we define keypoints/correspondences on two faces, which can be thought of as facial details
                    that we would like the warping mechanism to pay special attention to. The goal is to create a midway, and then 
                    later a morph, between the following two images of Robert Deniro and George Clooney:

                <img src="./images/deniro.jpg" />
                <img src="./images/george.jpg" />
                </div> 

                [The images are taken from the photographs by Martin Schoeller. While it was recommended to do the first few parts 
                with your own face, I found it much simpler to take a photo which had enough detail and was aligned well to focus on
                the face. Photographs by the same artist means similarity, and easier warping] 

                <br> 
                A total of 60 points were chosen to build the correspondence, giving arrays \(\text{arr1}\) and \(\text{arr2}\) of length
                60 each. We compute the average between the two image keypoints as \(\frac{1}{2}(  \text{arr1} + \text{arr2} ) \). 
                We then use <code>scipy.spatial.Delaunay</code> to compute a triangulation of the averaged points, which gives us 
                the average shape between the two faces. I implemented a custom labelling tool using <code>ginput</code>. In the next part, 
                we use this average triangulation to compute the midway face.

                <h2>Part 3.2: Computing the Midway face</h2>
                <p>
                    Let \(T = T_1 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup T_n \) and \(T' = T_1' \sqcup \cdots \sqcup T_n'\) be triangulations of two images. Then between triangles \(T_i\) and \(T_i'\), we wish to find an affine transformation \(A_i: T_i \to T_i'\) such that the vertices of \(T_i\) are mapped to the vertices of \(T_i'\). If \((x_j, y_j)\) and \((x_j', y_j')\) for \(j=1, 2, 3\) are the vertices of \(T_i\) and \(T_i'\) respectively, then

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
x_1' & x_2' & x_3' \\ 
y_1' & y_2' & y_3' \\ 
1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
= \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 
a & b & c \\ 
d & e & f \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}}_{=:A_i} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\ 
y_1 & y_2 & y_3 \\ 
1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} .
\]

Since the points form a triangle, the matrices other than \(A_i\) are invertible, and this is how we compute the affine transformation.

In reality, we will store 

\[
A_i^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 
x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\ 
y_1 & y_2 & y_3 \\ 
1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
x_1' & x_2' & x_3' \\ 
y_1' & y_2' & y_3' \\ 
1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\]

since that will be used for the inverse warp later.
