                <h2>Part 3.1: Defining Correspondences</h2>
                <p>
                    In this part, we define keypoints/correspondences on two faces, which can be thought of as facial details
                    that we would like the warping mechanism to pay special attention to. The goal is to create a midway, and then 
                    later a morph, between the following two images: 

                    <div class="gallery">
                <img src="./images/dinero.jpg" />
                <img src="./images/george.jpg" />
                </div> 

                [The images are taken from the photographs by Martin Schoeller. While it was recommended to do the first few parts 
                with your own face, I found it much simpler to take a photo which had enough detail and was aligned well to focus on
                the face. Photographs by the same artist means similarity, and easier warping] 

                <br> 
                A total of 60 points were chosen to build the correspondence, giving arrays \(\text{arr1}\) and \(\text{arr2}\) of length
                60 each. We compute the average between the two image keypoints as \(\frac{1}{2}(  \text{arr1} + \text{arr2} ) \). 
                We then use <code>scipy.spatial.Delaunay</code> to compute a triangulation of the averaged points, which gives us 
                the average shape between the two faces. I implemented a custom labelling tool using <code>ginput</code>. In the next part, 
                we use this average triangulation to compute the midway face.
