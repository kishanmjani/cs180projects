                <p>
                    We will use the <code> DeepFloydIF </code> diffusion model. We use a random seed of <code> seed = 10</code>, 
                    here and throughout the project. In this part, we simply test out the model, generating images 
                    for 3 text prompts with captions. We do this across different values of <code> num_inference_steps </code>.

                <h2>Part 4a.2: Computing Homographies and Warping Images</h2>
                <h3> Computing Homographies between keypoints</h3>
                <p>
                    Suppose we wish to send points \([wx:wy:w]\) (in \(\mathbb{P}^2\) projective space) to \([w'x':w'y':w']\) for 
                    indices \(i=1,2,\ldots, n\) (for conciceness, we supress the indices) via some homography \(H\) i.e.; 
                    \[ \begin{bmatrix} w'x'\\w'y'\\w'\end{bmatrix} = H \begin{bmatrix} wx\\wy\\w\end{bmatrix}\]
                </p>
                    
                <p>
    
                    Thus we have (scaling \(H\) to set \(h_{33} = 1\))
                \[ s \begin{bmatrix} x'\\y'\\1\end{bmatrix} = H \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} h_{11}& h_{12}& h_{13}\\h_{21}& h_{22}& h_{23}\\h_{31}& h_{32}& 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{bmatrix},\]
                    where we set \(s:= w'/w\). Then substituting the value for \(s\) from the third equation and rearranging, we get the linear 
                system 
                \[ \begin{bmatrix} x& y& 1& 0& 0& 0& -x'x& -x'y \\ 0& 0& 0& u& v& 1& -y'x& -y'y \end{bmatrix}  
\begin{bmatrix} h_{11} \\ h_{12} \\ h_{13} \\ h_{21} \\ h_{22} \\ h_{23} \\ h_{31} \\ h_{32} \end{bmatrix}  
=\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix}  \]
                For a batch of \(n\) distinct points, we then have the overdetermined linear system \(A \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{b}\)
                to solve, where \(\mathbf{h} = \begin{bmatrix} h_{11} & \cdots & h_{32} \end{bmatrix}^\top \) as above, \(A\) is a \(2n\times 8\)
                stacking \(n\) matrices of shapre \(2\times 8\) and form above. Finally, \(\mathbf{b}\) is formed by interleaving the new \(xy\)-coordinates
                \(x'\) and \(y'\). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now observe that this overdetermined system can be solved via least-squares, which then gives the best homography mapping 
                    \( (x_1,y_1),\ldots, (x_n,y_n) \) to \( (x_1',y_1'), \ldots, (x_n, y_n') \). 
                </p>

            <h3>Inverse Warp</h3>
                <p>
                  Once we have the homography \(H\), to actually transform the image, we will use an inverse warp. Specifically, we first determine the 
                    bounding box for the image by predicting where the corners map under \(H\). Then we find the pixel value of \((x',y')\) in the new image via 
                    
                    \[ g(x',y') = f(H^{-1}(x',y')) \]
                    so we set the new image pixels to be the the old-image pixel values for \(H^{-1}(\text{bounding box})\). To ensure that 
                    \(H^{-1}(\text{bounding box})\) hits integer coordinates, we use <code>scipy.interpolate.RegularGridInterpolator</code> like in the previous project.  
                    Multiple homographies can also be chained together to generate mosaics with \( > 2\) images.
                    <br>
                    Results of this section are presented in Image Rectification and Mosaicing.

                    Part 4a.3: Image Rectification (Contains Deliverables)
                </h2>
                <h3> Introduction</h3>
                    By setting the target keypoints to be a well-defined rectangle in the homography, given an image, we can select a feature that we know
                is rectangular to "rectify" it i.e, make it straight. 
                <br>
                Results in this section are highly sensitive to selection of points. Firstly, it is crucial that the points selected are accurate, 
                since rectification empirically proved to be highly sensitive to this. Furthermore, the ordering of points needs to be correct (otherwise 
                unintelligible results are produced since the image gets "flipped over itself"). 
                <br>
                Finally, to produce aesthetic images, the dimensions of the new rectified feature were chosen to be somewhat similar to those of the old 
                feature. 

                <h3> Results </h3>

                We present some examples of image rectification. Click the following link for results.

            <h2>
                Part 4a.4: Image Mosaicing (Contains Deliverables)
            </h2>
                <h3>Introduction </h3>
                Finally, we can use the developed machinery to create a mosaic using several images. The strategy is to choose 
                several corresponding keypoints (from prominent features) between the two images, and warp the first image into 
                the second so that keypoints map to keypoints (as best as possible). 
                <br>
                With this, we will have two images whose keypoints roughly match. In order to properly blend these images, we 
                use a distance transform on the alpha channel. This way, during the blending, we give more weight to the image 
                which is further from the background at a certain point. Specifically, 
                \[\text{Blended Image}[i,j] = \mathbb{1}_k\{ \text{dist}_1[i,j] > \text{dist}_2[i,j] \}\cdot \text{Image}_1[i,j] + \big( 1 -
                \mathbb{1}_k\{ \text{dist}_1[i,j] > \text{dist}_2[i,j] \} \big) \cdot \text{Image}_2[i,j].\]
                In order to ensure that the blending is smooth, we use a Gaussian blur on the indicator/mask 
                \[\mathbb{1}_k\{ \text{dist}_1[i,j] > \text{dist}_2[i,j]\} = \text{Gaussian}(\sigma_k = 2^k \sigma_0, \text{window} =
                \lfloor 6\sigma_k \rfloor +1) \star \mathbb{1}\{ \text{dist}_1[i,j] > \text{dist}_2[i,j]\},\]
                skipping the first few steps in the Gaussian stack until the mask is sufficiently blurred. This ensures that there are no 
                edge artifacts in the final product. 
                
                <h3>Results </h3>
                Click the following link for results. Across all cases, we start with \(\sigma_0 = 7\) and skip the first \(2\)
                images from the Gaussian Stack of the mask, with depth \(5\).
