                <p>
                    In this part, we manually touch grass (whoa!) and shoot some photos. To ensure that the photos can be stitched together well, it is important to shoot
                  all images while fixing the position of the lens. Additionally, a wide-angle lens is recommended. 
                  Furthermore, it is recommended that we overlap the fields of view significantly. 40% to 70% overlap is recommended. 
                  Too little overlap makes registration harder.

                    Part 4a.3: Image Rectification (Contains Deliverables)
                </h2>
                <h3> Introduction</h3>
                    Any particular instance of the morph sequence, as described in the project outline, is given by the function 
                    <code>morph_fixed(im1, pts_arr1, im2, pts_arr2, simplices, warp_frac, dissolve_frac, channel)</code>, 
                    and produces a morphing .gif file that takes im1 to im2 as <code>warp_frac</code> and <code>dissolve_frac</code> go from 0 to 1. In future parts, 
                    we will also explore the impact of differently varying warp_frac and dissolve_frac. 

                <h3> Results </h3>

                We present some examples of image rectification. Click the following link for results.
