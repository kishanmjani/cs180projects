                <h2>Part 4a.1: Shooting the Images</h2>
                <p>
                    In this part, we manually touch grass (whoa!) and shoot some photos. To ensure that the photos can be stitched together well, it is important to shoot
                  all images while fixing the position of the lens. Additionally, a wide-angle lens is recommended. 
                  Furthermore, it is recommended that we overlap the fields of view significantly. 40% to 70% overlap is recommended. 
                  Too little overlap makes registration harder. 
                <br>
                To see the images shot, click on the following link:

                <h2>Part 4a.2: Computing Homographies and Warping Images</h2>
                <h3> Computing Homographies between keypoints</h3>
                <p>
                    Suppose we wish to send points \([wx:wy:w]\) (in \(\mathbb{P}^2\) projective space) to \([w'x':w'y':w']\) for 
                    indices \(i=1,2,\ldots, n\) (for conciceness, we supress the indices) via some homography \(H\) i.e.; 
                    \[ \begin{bmatrix} w'x'\\w'y'\\w'\end{bmatrix} = H \begin{bmatrix} wx\\wy\\w\end{bmatrix}\]
                </p>
                    
                <p>
    
                    Thus we have (scaling \(H\) to set \(h_{33} = 1\))
                \[ s \begin{bmatrix} x'\\y'\\1\end{bmatrix} = H \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} h_{11}, h_{12}, h_{13}\\h_{21}, h_{22}, h_{23}\\h_{31}, h_{32}, 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{bmatrix},\]
                    where we set \(s:= w'/w\). Then substituting the value for \(s\) from the third equation and rearranging, we get the linear 
                system 
                \[ \begin{bmatrix} x& y& 1& 0& 0& 0& -x'x& -x'y \\ 0& 0& 0& u& v& 1& -y'x& -y'y \end{bmatrix}  
\begin{bmatrix} h_{11} \\ h_{12} \\ h_{13} \\ h_{21} \\ h_{22} \\ h_{23} \\ h_{31} \\ h_{32} \end{bmatrix}  
=\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix}  \]
                For a batch of \(n\) distinct points, we then have the overdetermined linear system \(A \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{b}\)
                to solve, where \(\mathbf{h} = \begin{bmatrix} h_{11} & \cdots & h_{32} \end{bmatrix}^\top \) as above, \(A\) is a \(2n\times 8\)
                stacking \(n\) matrices of shapre \(2\times 8\) and form above. Finally, \(\mathbf{b}\) is formed by interleaving the new \(xy\)-coordinates
                \(x'\) and \(y'\). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now observe that this overdetermined system can be solved via least-squares, which then gives the best homography mapping 
                    \( (x_1,y_1),\ldots, (x_n,y_n) \) to \( (x_1',y_1'), \ldots, (x_n, y_n') \). 
                </p>

            <h3>Inverse Warp</h3>
                <p>
                  Once we have the homography, to actually transform the image, we will use an inverse warp. Specifically, we first determine the 
                    bounding box \(T\) for the image by predicting where the corners map. Then we find the pixel value of \((x',y')\) in the new image via 
                    
                    \[ g(x',y') = f(T^{-1}(x',y')) \]
                    so we set the new image pixels to be the the old-image pixel values for \(T^{-1}(\text{bounding box})\). To ensure that 
                    \(T^{-1}(\text{bounding box})\) hits integers, we use <code>scipy.interpolate.RegularGridInterpolator</code> as last time. 
                    Multiple homographies can also be chained together to generate mosaics with \( > 2\) images.

                    Part 4a.3: Image Rectification (Contains Deliverables)
                </h2>
                <h3> Introduction</h3>
                    Any particular instance of the morph sequence, as described in the project outline, is given by the function 
                    <code>morph_fixed(im1, pts_arr1, im2, pts_arr2, simplices, warp_frac, dissolve_frac, channel)</code>, 
                    and produces a morphing .gif file that takes im1 to im2 as <code>warp_frac</code> and <code>dissolve_frac</code> go from 0 to 1. In future parts, 
                    we will also explore the impact of differently varying warp_frac and dissolve_frac.
