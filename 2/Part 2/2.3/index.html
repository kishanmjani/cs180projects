            <h3> Recreating the outcomes of Figure 3.42 in Szelski (Ed 2) page 167,</h3>
            <br>
          We use \( d = 7, \sigma = 4\) for the depth of the stack and standard deviation of the first Gaussian, respectively. The window size for the Gaussian 
                kernel was once again taken to be \( k = 6[\sigma] + 1 \). Furthermore, for better results, we skip the first two masks in order to have smoother transition
                between the two images (i.e. we start choosing masks once they are smoothened enough by a Gaussian).

            <h3>Observations</h3>
                For the image <code>everest.jpg</code>, notice that while sharpening the image brings back some contrast and a large number of the mountains features, there is still an element of blur (a net loss of information) from the blurring. The edges are not as sharp as before, and the color contrast is a bit off. Thus we see that sharpening does not really create any new information/details, but only rephrases the existing information in a way that produces an apparently "sharper" image.
