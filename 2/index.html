                <h2>Part 1: Fun with Filters</h2>
                <p>
                    In this part, we build intuitions about 2D convolutions and filtering.
<br>
                    This is done primarily through visualizing what convolutions with the derivative look like.
<br>
                    IMPORTANT NOTE: For clarity, this webpage contains a link where images before and after alignment are 
                    displayed. For the webpage pdf, this other page has been attached at the bottom for convenience of viewing. 
                    Clicking links to Images and Cropped Images below will lead to the aforementioned pages.

                <h3> Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator</h3>

                Our goal here is to visually see what the convolutions \(f\star D_x\) and \(f\star D_y \) do to an image \(f\), where \(D_x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( D_y = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \) are finite difference operators. This is done with the cameraman image

               <h3> Part 1.2: Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) filters</h3>

                Our goal here is to experiment with Derivative of Gaussian filters, done again with the cameraman image.

                We will be able to create various interesting images (sharper images from blurred ones, hybrid images, blended images) using tricks with frequency and the Gaussian. 

                <h3> Part 2.1: Image Sharpening </h3>
                Let \(G\)  be a Gaussian Filter and let \(I\) be the identity filter. If \(f\star G\) blurs an image, then for \(\alpha > 0\) we can use the formula \( f - f\star G\) to construct an image of "details". Then 
                \[ f_s(\alpha) = f + \alpha(f-f\star G) = f\star[ (1+\alpha) I - \alpha G ] \] 
                is a sharpened image i.e. an image with more details.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Using these simple techniques, most of the generated images are sufficiently clear. The only image which 
                    seems to remain fairly blurry is cathedral.jpg, for which advanced techniques might be more helpful. I think 
                    the image can be made significantly sharper by using more careful edge detection. Specifically, accentuating 
                    the edge of the cathedral would likely produce good results. 
                    <br>
                    Additionally, it would be great to implement a more efficient contrast normalization, or explore other techniques, 
                    which would produce a more natural coloration for some of the images. Along similar lines, automatic edge detection
                    and cropping would be a great plus for images of more varying sizes.
