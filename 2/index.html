                <h2>Part 1: Fun with Filters</h2>
                <p>
                    In this part, we build intuitions about 2D convolutions and filtering.
<br>
                    This is done primarily through visualizing what convolutions with the derivative look like.
<br>
                    IMPORTANT NOTE: For clarity, this webpage contains a link where images before and after alignment are 
                    displayed. For the webpage pdf, this other page has been attached at the bottom for convenience of viewing. 
                    Clicking links to Images and Cropped Images below will lead to the aforementioned pages.

                <h3> Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator</h3>

                Our goal here is to visually see what the convolutions \(f\star D_x\) and \(f\star D_y \) do to an image \(f\), where \(D_x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( D_y = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \) are finite difference operators. This is done with the cameraman image

                Our goal here is to experiment with Derivative of Gaussian filters, done again with the cameraman image.

                <h2>Part 2: </h2>
                We will be able to create various interesting images (sharper images from blurred ones, hybrid images, blended images) using tricks with frequency and the Gaussian. 

                <h3> Part 2.1: Image Sharpening </h3>
                Let \(G\)  be a Gaussian Filter and let \(I\) be the identity filter. If \(f\star G\) blurs an image, then for \(\alpha > 0\) we can use the formula \( f - f\star G\) to construct an image of "details". Then 
                \[ f_s(\alpha) = f + \alpha(f-f\star G) = f\star[ (1+\alpha) I - \alpha G ] \] 
                is a sharpened image i.e. an image with more details.

                <h3> Part 2.2: Hybrid Images </h3>

                We take as input images <code> im1</code> and <code>im2 </code>, and wish to construct a combined image <code>im</code> that looks like <code>im1</code> at high frequencies and <code>im2</code> at low frequencies. This can be accomplished by taking Gaussian filters \( g_1 := g_1(\sigma_1,k) \) and \(g_2 := g_2(\sigma_2,k) \) based on empirically chosen deviations and window size \( [6\sigma] + 1\), chosen to be sufficient to fit three standard deviations (most of the variation of a Gaussian) inside the Gaussian kernel. We generate low frequency <code>im1</code> by convolution with Gaussian \( g_1\). We generate high frequency <code>im2</code> via \(\texttt{im2} \gets \texttt{im2} - \texttt{im2} \star g_2 \). Summing these images and normalizing, we have our desired hybrid image. From nearby, it should look like the high frequency image, and from further away it looks like the low frequency image.

                <h3> Part 2.3: Gaussian and Laplacian Stacks</h3>

                A Gaussian Stack is a sequence of images where each subsequent image is given from the previous one via convolution with a Gaussian: 
                \[ g_{i+1} = g_i \star \textup{Gauss}(\sigma_{i+1},k) \] 
                where \( \sigma_{i+1} = 2\sigma_i \) and \( \sigma_0 \) is chosen. In a certain sense, they give blurrier and blurrier versions of the first image. 
                A Laplacian stack is defined as having \[ \ell_{i+1} = g_{i+1} - g_i \], where \( g_i\) is the \(i\)th image in the Gaussian stack. It records the 
                difference in details (or the details lost) between convolving by a certain $g_i$.

                <h3> Part 2.4: Multi-Resolution Blending</h3>

                We use Masking in order to blend images together and create interesting visuals. The idea is to sum various layers of the Laplacian pyramid of an image with an appropriate mask filter applied to the two images being blended.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Using these simple techniques, most of the generated images are sufficiently clear. The only image which 
                    seems to remain fairly blurry is cathedral.jpg, for which advanced techniques might be more helpful. I think 
                    the image can be made significantly sharper by using more careful edge detection. Specifically, accentuating 
                    the edge of the cathedral would likely produce good results. 
                    <br>
                    Additionally, it would be great to implement a more efficient contrast normalization, or explore other techniques, 
                    which would produce a more natural coloration for some of the images. Along similar lines, automatic edge detection
                    and cropping would be a great plus for images of more varying sizes.
