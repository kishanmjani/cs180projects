                <h2>Part 1: Fun with Filters</h2>
                <p>
                    In this part, we build intuitions about 2D convolutions and filtering.
<br>
                    This is done primarily through visualizing what convolutions with the derivative look like.
<br>
                    IMPORTANT NOTE: For clarity, this webpage contains a link where images before and after alignment are 
                    displayed. For the webpage pdf, this other page has been attached at the bottom for convenience of viewing. 
                    Clicking links to Images and Cropped Images below will lead to the aforementioned pages.

                <h3> Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator</h3>

                Our goal here is to visually see what the convolutions \(f\star D_x\) and \(f\star D_y \) do to an image \(f\), where \(D_x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( D_y = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \) are finite difference operators. This is done with the cameraman image

                <h2>Part 2: </h2>

                <h3> Part 2.1 </h3>
                    
    

                <h3> Part 2.2 </h3>
                For larger images (stored in .tif format), a naive single-scale approach is not practical for two primary reasons: 
<br>
1. The pixel array has larger shape, which makes our exhaustive search take longer. 
                <br>
2. The optimal displacement is likely larger than what the initial search space \( [-15,15] \) explores; for instance, 
\( (50,23) \) for RED and \( (107,40) \) for GREEN works well for emir.tif. We would need to expand our search space to 
something of the order \( [-100,100] \) to produce a sharp image with exhaustive search, which blows up the runtime. 
<br>
The remedy to these issues comes from using an image pyramid. The idea is to repeatedly scale the image (factor 
of \( 2 \) chosen) until the pixel array is of reasonably small dimensions. 
                <br>
(i) First, at level \(i\) of scaling (that is, image is scaled by \( 2^i \) ), we find the optimal displacement \( d_i \)
    for the scaled versions using a smaller search space, starting from \( i=L\) (maximum scaling) all the way to \(i=0\).
                Specifically, the smaller search space used was \([-4,4]\)
                <br>
    (ii) For the original image, the corresponding displacement we implement is \( D_i = 2^{i}\cdot d_i \).
                <br>
    (iii) We add the optimal displacements to generate the best displacement for the original image: 
                \[ \text{best displacement} = \sum_{i=0}^L D_i = \sum_{i=0}^L 2^i \cdot d_i \]
    (iv) The final step is to translate the original RED/GREEN frame by the best displacement to generate our aligned frame.

Note that this allows us to explore a wider range of displacements while saving on computational cost, due to the weighting by doubling factor \( 2^i \). Empirically, L=6 was the maximum depth of doubling chosen. 
<br>
Additionally, a Sobel filter was used for edge detection to improve the alignment, focusing on salient features of the image (the edge borders of major objects) to align first.

                <h3> Bells and Whistles: Contrast Normalization and Cropping </h3>

                I also tried using contrast normalization and cropping to improve the aesthetic view of the images. For contrast normalization, the formula used was 
                \[ \text{image}_{ij} \leftarrow \text{image}_{ij} - \min(\text{image}) \]
                \[ \text{image}_{ij} \leftarrow \frac{\text{image}_{ij}}{\max(\text{image})} \]
                While this produced slightly more natural colors for the images, the result is barely noticeable. In the future, I think stronger contrast normalization techniques need to be used for a more discernable impact. 
                <br>
                For cropping, I used a straightforward approach of removing 5 percent of the image from all sides. This 
                was pretty comprehensive in removing the borders, producing cleaner images. 
                <br>
                The results are available to view in the Cropped Images section of Results below.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Using these simple techniques, most of the generated images are sufficiently clear. The only image which 
                    seems to remain fairly blurry is cathedral.jpg, for which advanced techniques might be more helpful. I think 
                    the image can be made significantly sharper by using more careful edge detection. Specifically, accentuating 
                    the edge of the cathedral would likely produce good results. 
                    <br>
                    Additionally, it would be great to implement a more efficient contrast normalization, or explore other techniques, 
                    which would produce a more natural coloration for some of the images. Along similar lines, automatic edge detection
                    and cropping would be a great plus for images of more varying sizes.
