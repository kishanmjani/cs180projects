            <h3> Finite Difference operator on Gaussian filtered-image</h3>
            With \(f\) being the grayscale cameraman.png image again, let \(g\) denote a Gaussian filter. For our results, we used window size \(k=9\) and standard deviation \(\sigma = 1.5\) to create our \(9\times 9\) Gaussian filter. Using once again <code>scipy.signal.convolve2d</code> with symmetric boundaries and <code>mode='same'</code>, we get the images below:

    <h3> Derivative of Gaussian filters on the image</h3>
            Using once again <code>scipy.signal.convolve2d</code> with symmetric boundaries and <code>mode='same'</code>, the difference now is that we first compute \(  g\star D_x\) and \(g\star D_y\) and then later compute \( (g\star D_x) \star f\) and \( (g\star D_y) \star f\). We will see that the outputs from both approaches are identical, which shows that convolution commutes and associates. We get the images below:

            <h3>Comparison with Part 1.1: Removal of Noise</h3>

            One of the most significant features in comparing images from Part 1.1 and Part 1.2 is that there is virtually no noise near the bottom of the binarized images in Part 1.2 images as compared to Part 1.1 images. Furthermore, we have much thicker edges in this case, so DoG filters seem to be visually functioning a lot better than standard finite difference operators. 
          <div class="gallery">
                <img src="../../results/bin_cameraman_grad.jpg"  />
                <img src="../../results/bin_cameraman_second_grad.jpg"  />
                </div>
            Note that a Gaussian filter has these properties because as a smooth function, convolution smoothens out the images and removes the effect of outliers (the binarizer ensures now lower-value outliers are removed). However, it is also important to note that blurring decreases the value of all pixels, so our threshold choice <code> thresh = 0.07</code> is also much lower to actually detect edges. Specifically, while at the same thresh finite difference operators detect more edges, the edges detected by DoG filters are thicker and more immune to noise. 

            <h3>Commutativity of Convolution</h3>
                Notice that DoG filtering vs. Blurring and then using finite difference operators produces virtually the same output, barring minor differences due to noise:

                <img src="../../results/bin_cameraman_second_Dy.jpg"  />
                </div>
                This simply reflects the facts that \(f\star(g\star h) = (f\star g) \star h\) and \(f\star g = g\star f\) for convolutions, so we can do convolution operations in an order that is most convenient.
